The menu that appears in the video, its a menu from my server, its not a part of this script.

This script is made to work with [Kuana_Garage 2.0](https://forum.fivem.net/t/new-release-esx-kuana-garage-2-0-need-esx-vehicleshop/273862). If you use other garage system, please care with possible glitches !!

I will provide some support, but dont ask me things that can give me serious mental deceases....
